#What is Gaya Design all about?

Gaya Design is a weblog about web development written and managed by Gaya Kessler, a guy from a small town in the Netherlands. Since I got the chance (and knowledge) to get my hands dirty with web development Iâ€™ve been in love with it. Just two years after starting to learn how to make websites I took a job as a web developer. Not much longer after that I started writing articles which ended up on this website.
