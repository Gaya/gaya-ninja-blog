For the last couple of years, I spent a lot of time working on personal projects next to my day time jobs. I even decided to work four days instead of five to spend an extra day doing what I love: getting my hands dirty on stuff I came up with myself.

Because this still feels like I still have too little time and I want to focus on building my own projects, I decided to quit my job. Which is kind of a jump in at the deep end.

What will I be doing?
---------------------

The last couple of months I have been working on a project which I will soon post more information about. Most of my time in the near future will be spent on this product's launch and I hope to do so soon.

In the meantime, I want to focus some more on pet projects like **[Drammit](https://www.dramm.it)** and **Open Source Software** I have on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/Gaya). It's been quite a while since I made the time to improve on them.

Also, **blogging**. I used to love writing about stuff I learned on my blog, but I quickly lost interest when development became a day to day thing. It felt like everything I could write about was already on the Internet, explained by much smarter people than I.

Expect articles about _React_, _Redux_, and how to tackle certain problems while making (web) apps.

Available for work
------------------

Aside from all of the above, I will be **available for hire**. I plan on taking on some jobs to pay the bills and expenses made working on my projects. Life is not free.

Feel free to [contact me](https://www.theclevernode.com/#contact) if you're looking for an _expert in JavaScript, React, and web applications_ in general.

Onwards to a bright future
--------------------------

I am very excited to start working on all the ideas I have and figure out how my future is going to look like.

For now I am curious and calm at the same time. Only time can tell how all will work out.
