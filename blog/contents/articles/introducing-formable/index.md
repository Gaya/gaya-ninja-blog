Today I am very pleased to reveal to you what I've been working on for the last couple of months.

[Formable](https://www.getformable.com) is a service I developed which will help you create forms and embed them on your websites. Without the hassle of coding the whole form yourself or installing another unnecessary plugin.

## Why Formable?
When I create a website of any kind, I find that coding forms is always a tedious and boring task. Especially if you need to create a way to handle messages and their input.

It's time-consuming, and overall a task I wouldn't mind skipping.

Imagine assembling a form and then adding a snippet of embed code to your site is all you have to do: this is Formable.

## Perfect for all types of websites
It doesn't matter if you run a WordPress site, created your website with a service like Wix, or if you just have a static website. _Formable will fit perfectly on all these platforms_ and will work the same everywhere.

Because Formable is embedded with a simple external script, you won't need to add your own backend code or install a plugin. It will work out of the box!

## Evolving possibilities
You can create contact forms, subscription forms, surveys, and more. With the online form builder, you can create forms to your liking.

Fields can be validated before they are sent to you. Make them required fields, have an email address check. _Remember, you don't have to code anything for this_!

Formable is also easily adjusted with some plain CSS. You can even choose to exclude CSS from the embedded forms altogether.

I am working on improving the possibilities of Formable. If you have any suggestions: please reach out!
