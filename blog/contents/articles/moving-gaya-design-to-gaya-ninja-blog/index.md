Since 2008 I've been blogging with the name "Gaya Design". Which is pretty weird since I am not even blogging about
design and am not professionally a designer. It was time to make a move to a different domain and operate on a new name.

I am very proud to introduce to you: Gaya Ninja Blog.

##My branding needed a change
Ever since my blog took off I felt like I was stuck with the name I once choose to host my blog on. Even before it was
a blog I kind of struggled with the name. It's one I made up a long time ago when I started getting into web design.

At that time I didn't even know whether I'd go with design or development. I really liked both at the time, but went
with development pretty soon, which I am very thankful for.

When I finally found the time to do something about this problem I began rebranding small parts of my online presence.
(My Twitter account)[https://twitter.com/gayaninja] has been renamed to @GayaNinja for a while now and I launched a
website for my personal / professional profile at (http://gaya.ninja)[http://gaya.ninja].
